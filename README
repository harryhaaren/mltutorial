[UPDATE: Warning - this tutorial is 6 years old and may not work as expected anymore.
 I suggest checking out the "BuildOnMe" repo on the MLT page: https://github.com/mltframework/BuildOnMe]

  MlTutorial:

This is a small repo of example clients for the MLT framework.
It documents my own learning of the framework, and hopefully provides
good examples to learn from for others also learning MLT.

This page gives an overview of Melt, a commandline program using MLT,
and is the best "high level" overview of functionality that I've found yet:
